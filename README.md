# streamsplitter
The first project in a series of projects for new engineering solutions in data encryption. Splitting digital streams in encryption<br>
We use a digital noise stream for data encryption and with an increase in the project number (streamsplitter2, 3, ...) we will improve it<br>
In projects, we will generate encryption keys on the side of the sender and recipient without using synchronization channels (secretly)
